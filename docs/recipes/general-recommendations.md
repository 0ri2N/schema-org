<script setup lang="ts">
const breadcrumbs = [
  {
    name: 'Home',
    url: '/'
  },
  {
    name: 'About',
    url: '/about'
  }
]

useSchemaOrgBreadcrumbs(breadcrumbs)
</script>
```

### Headless UI component

```vue
<template>
<SchamaOrgBreadcrumbs :items="items">
  <template #link="{ text, link }">>
    <nuxt-link :to="link">text</nuxt-link>
  </template>
</SchamaOrgBreadcrumbs>
</template>
```


## Page Type Augmentation

## Page Schema.org Setup

Once you have setup your global Schema.org, it's now time to fine-tune what each page is serving.

To start with you can start specifying the types of your pages, then move on to Schema.org which will
benefit you in Google results.

### Basic: Page Type

Say you're working on a site with an about page. It's useful to specify the type as follows.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useSchemaOrg, defineWebPage } from "vueuse-schema-org";

useSchemaOrg([
  // Because the @id isn't specified, this will merge with our global WebPage
  defineWebPage({
    '@type': 'AboutPage'
  })
])
</script>
```
