## Background

Implementing Schema.org for websites is the easiest way to unlock Google Rich Results for your search appearance.

Devs are currently embedding Schema.org in ld+json script tags, and it works!

However, vanilla Schema.org is a complex, verbose and boilerplate heavy solution:
- Option paralysis in which Schema to implement and which fields to use
- Limited and confusing documentation on best practices
- Nested Schema adding unnecessary kB to page weight
- Schema.org `@id` and `url` references when manually configured are brittle

This package aims to solve all of these issues, following the best practices from SEO giant Yoast and Google's own documentation.
