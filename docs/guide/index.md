## Background

Implementing Schema.org is the easiest way to opt-in to [Google Rich Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery).
The improved visibility of Rich Results has been shown
to [improve click-through rates](https://simplifiedsearch.net/case-study-the-impact-of-rich-results-on-impressions-clicks-and-organic-traffic/).

Existing solutions to add Schema.org ld+json script tags work.

However, implementing and maintaining Schema has issues:
- Option paralysis in which Schema to implement and how
- Limited and confusing documentation on best practices
- Nested Schema adding unnecessary kB to page weight
- Managing `@id` and `url` references are brittle

This package aims to solve all of these issues,
following the best practices from SEO giant Yoast and Google's own documentation.
